Ad hoc scripts/tooling for markdown generation for emails to people of interest (i.e. Mayors, City Attornies, etc.)
---
* Helper script: `markdown_email_gen.py` is a dumb helper script that takes `contact_person_generic_template.md` and generates Markdown files under the `_links/email` subdirectory
* `sms_gen/` contains a dumb bash script that takes manually downloaded pictures from [Resistbot's Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/openletterbot/) and uses the `tesseract` command line utility tool to create autogenerated Markdown files to be placed under the `sms/` subdirectory. Note a human will still take a look and refine the autogenerated Markdown files.
