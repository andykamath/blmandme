# BLM and Me

I made this as one crowdsourced list of things people can do to take action ASAP.

If you want to contribute, please don't hesitate to make a pull request! That's what this site is for! 

## To make a contribution:

1) Go to the \_links directory
2) There, you'll see categories for links. Every type of link must have these attributes: **type, message, representation, impact**. 
3) Create a markdown file with the appropriate tags. 

**Here are some templates with the correct tags to use:**

### Email:
**addresses**: "email1@email.com,email2@email.com,email3@gmail.com" (**MAKE SURE TO SEPARATE BY COMMAS**)
**subject**: "This is what I want the email subject to be"
**body**: "Hello,

This is an email."
**message**: "Use this template to email Minnesota officials to hold them accountable" (this will be shown on the site to tell people as a headline what your link will do)
**representation**: "Supporter" (Who are you? This helps people identify movements and causes they most identify with)
**impact**: "This is the impact of going to this link" (This helps people get a better idea of what they're signing up for when they visit your link)
