title: "Text WMGPYA to 50409 to sign End Legal immunity for Police Misconduct"
representation: "ResistBot"
impact: "I'm a constituent from your district and I'm very concerned about the ongoing violence police officers are using against civilians. I ask you to please support and consider co-sponsoring Rep. Amashs “Ending Qualified Immunity Act” to restore Americans rights to seek relief when their civil rights are violated. If the President won't sign it, please make every attempt to override a veto. Americans will not tolerate special protections for abuses of power by corrupt or violent officers. I'll be eagerly looking for your public announcement of support. And I'll certainly be voting in November with this issue in mind. Thank you for your time and consideration."
