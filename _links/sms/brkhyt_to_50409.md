title: "Text BRKHYT to 50409 to sign Reinstate Habeas Corpus immediately"
representation: "ResistBot"
impact: "I am appalled by the suspension of habeas corpus in New York City. Especially as police forces demonstrate again and again that they only protect and serve us when we align with their personal interests, this is NOT the time to allow a clearly partisan force to hold people without a cause. Especially during a pandemic, this is NOT the time to crowd jails simply because people are protesting. Please do what you can to right this wrong. Thank you."
