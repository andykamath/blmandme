title: "Text MXZNAT to 50409 to sign Ban the Use of Tear Gas on Protesters"
representation: "ResistBot"
impact: "Please ban the usage of tear gas on citizens of the United States. As seen in the Geneva Protocol of 1925, tear gas is classified as a chemical warfare agent. There has been a confirmed death, Sarah Grossman, who had a fatal asthma attack when she came in contact with tear gas. If we cannot use tear gas against our enemies in war, why is it allowed to be used against our own soil? The constitution of this nation states to establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty. Tear gas being used on peaceful protesters is NOT keeping anything in check, and if anything, is creating more issues. The right to free peacefully assemble is thrown out of the window when the police use tear gas to disperse a crowd when it is unnecessary. Please take into consideration that we can vote you out of office, listen to the people."
