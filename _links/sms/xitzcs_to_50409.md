title: "Text XITZCS to 50409 to sign Please support the “Ending Qualified Immunity Act”"
representation: "ResistBot"
impact: "I am aconstituent from your district and I am very concerned about the ongoing violence police officers are using against civilians. I ask you to please support and consider co-sponsoring Rep. Amash's “Ending Qualified Immunity Act” to restore Americans rights to seek relief when their civil rights are violated. If the President wont sign it, please make every attempt to override a veto. Americans will not tolerate special protections for abuses of power by corrupt or violent officers. I will be eagerly looking for your public announcement of support. And I will certainly be voting in November with this issue in mind. Thank you for your time and consideration."
