title: "Text UVNASF to 50409 to sign Immediate Reinstatement of Habeas Corpus in New York"
representation: "ResistBot"
impact: " The suspension of Habeas Corpus in New York City is absolutely criminal, corrupt, and unacceptable. You cannot fathomably attempt to justify that behavior under any circumstances. We have video evidence of NYPD brutally attacking your constituents - the very people who put you in office in return for you to offer us protection. Frankly, your prioritization of your so-called peace over justice and the right to protest are absurd, dehumanizing, and unjust. I call for the immediate reinstatement of Habeas Corpus, as well as the immediate instatement of all 8 demands currently requested by the NAACP. Suspending Habeas Corpus is not an act of safety. It is a threat to our freedom, collective mourning, and collective anger at the systemic racism that NYPD has continuously upheld since its founding. While I currently only call for the reinstatement of Habeas Corpus, please know I will be writing you on many more occasions to demand change to many more malpractices that you have contributed to in perpetuity for many years and are continuing to escalate."
