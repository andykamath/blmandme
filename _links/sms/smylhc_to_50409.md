impact: "As your constituent I am writing to request an immediate bill for the federal suspension of “no-knock” warrants — which undoubtedly lead to more civilian death at the hands of law enforcement. The issuance of “no knock” warrants allows law enforcement to enter private property without knocking or announcing themselves. Oftentimes, civilians confuse these unannounced raids as potential break ins. Police raids supported by these warrants have led to countless, unnecessary civilian deaths. Most recently, Breonna Taylor, in Louisville, Kentucky, was murdered by law enforcement after they obtained a “no knock” warrant and forced themselves into her home as part of a drug raid. It was later found that there was no evidence of acrime by Ms. Taylor, and yet she paid with her life. Following her death and amid protests, the Metro Council Committee in Louisville suspended the use of “no knock” warrants. I urge representatives to present a federal bill that suspends “no knock” warrants nationwide so that no more civilian lives are lost and this egregious ovestep of police force is limited."
