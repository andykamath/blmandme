impact: "The unnecessary, gruesome death of George Floyd has again highlighted the desperate need for police reform in this country. Black families should not have to live in fear that their loved ones will die, without reason and without representation, in the streets at the hands of a force that has sworn to protect its citizens. The fact that so many black men have been killed by police and no significant systemic action has been taken is heartbreaking and shameful. We need to immediately implement procedures that emphasize empathy, mental health, and de-escalation. The officers involved need to be not only fired, but brought up on criminal charges. The entire police culture should be examined and reformed to align with science- based best practices and person-centered ethics. The only effective way to police is to have a force rooted in, and representative of, the community which it protects, and that is well trained in providing support, making social connections, and recognizing and preventing racial bias. That is so clearly lacking, and the senseless death of another man has underlined this shortcoming yet again. Drastic moves need to be made right now to save lives. How many more people will die before we start making changes? Let George Floyd be the last. Let his legacy be the change that saves lives."
