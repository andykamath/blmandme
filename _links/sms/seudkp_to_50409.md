title: "Text SEUDKP to 50409 to sign Ending Qualified Immunity Act"
representation: "ResistBot"
impact: "Recently, Congressman Justin Amash (MI-03) proposed the Ending Qualified Immunity Act to eliminate qualified immunity and restore Americans' ability to obtain relief when police officers violate their constitutionally secured rights. Additionally, Congresswomen Ayanna Pressley (MA-07) and Ilhan Omar (MN-05) introduced a resolution condemning police brutality, racial profiling, and the excessive use of force. Both of these proposals were in response to the recent murder of George Floyd and the history of violent policing towards Black Americans. I urge you to sponsor/sign both of these forms to support anti-racism and to fulfill your duty of upholding democracy."
