body: "To whom it may concern,

My name is [YOUR NAME HERE] and I am a resident of [YOUR CITY, YOUR STATE]. I’m emailing today on behalf of the George Floyd case. I’m calling for the prosecution of Derek Chauvin #1087 and his partner Tou Thao #7162 to the fullest extent of the law and that you will not rest until that happens. George Floyd was arrested under an implied, non-violent crime and bystanders claim that he never resisted his arrest. The approach that the officers chose to take was one that resulted in murder and must not be taken lightly.

Black Lives Matter.

Regards,
[YOUR NAME HERE]"
