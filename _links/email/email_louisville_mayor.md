body: "Hello,

My name is [YOUR NAME]. I’m emailing today on behalf of the Breonna Taylor case. I’m calling for the prosecution of Sergeant Jonathan Mattingly, Brett Hankison and Myles Cosgrove to the fullest extent of the law- we will not stop until that happens. The man the officers were looking for didn't even live in the same building and was already in custody. Kenneth Walker acted in self defense, and for this he should not be prosecuted. The approach that the officers chose to take in arriving in plain clothes, unmarked cars and not announcing themselves was one that resulted in murder and must not be taken lightly.

Black Lives Matter.

Regards."
