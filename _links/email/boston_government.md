body: "Hello,

My name is [YOUR NAME]. I'm writing to you to say that I believe public services funding should be prioritized over funding additional police forces. I believe in the right to nonviolent protest and firmly stand against excessive police force to break up a nonviolent crowd. Additional funding to a police force that has painfully broken up multiple nonviolent crowds will only result in further harm to the people that want to have their voices heard. That being said, funding in the order of millions of dollars goes firmly against what I stand for as an American and as a resident of the City of Boston. I strongly urge you to listen to the voices of the people that have tried other ways of protest only to be shut down with no tangible results yet. 

Black Lives Matter.

Regards."
title: "BOSTON RESIDENTS - Use this template to email the Boston City Council to prevent additional funding of around $2m to police force."
representation: "Anirudh Kamath"
impact: "Boston Police have shown that they have little patience even for nonviolent crowds, using tear gas and making things exceptionally violent and forceful when crowds were not violent first. Additional funding on the order of millions of dollars will only further encourage this behavior and harm the residents of Boston who want to have their voices heard."
